# ChestXRayPneumoniaClassifier
Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that affects millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate detection of pneumonia can greatly assist healthcare professionals in providing timely treatment. This project leverages the power of transfer learning to build pneumonia detection models using two popular pre-trained models: VGG and ResNet.

Transfer learning allows us to take advantage of the knowledge learned by these models on large-scale image classification tasks and apply it to our specific problem of pneumonia detection. By utilizing pre-trained models, we can save time and computational resources while achieving good performance.
